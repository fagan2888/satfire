  - external mask data
    - water/land
    - land cover
    - NWC SAF cloud mask
  - resampling to swath
    - resample_aux()

* saving
  - fileformat(s)?

* Use probability levels from utils.py
* Add night-time test data + test cases
* Add unittests for utils.read_sat_data
* Add unittests for forest_fire.ForestFire.check_static_masks()
* Add unittests for utils.check_static_masks()

* Static mask data
  - save static masks as regular lon/lat grids with resolution and
    center-point coordinates of the origin as attributes
    -> pixel locations can be calculated analytically
  - add function to calculate how many pixels are needed to cover the footprint
    at the latitude in question
  - Use HDF5 for storage and memmapping to reduce memory footprint when reading
    mask data
